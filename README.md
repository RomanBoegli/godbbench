# Abstract
The goal of this paper is to analyse the differences of relational and graph-based database management systems. The representatives used as concrete implementation of these two paradigms will be PostgreSQL (relational) and Neo4j (graph-based).

The first part of this work will elaborate the background of these technologies with focus on the history, popular use cases, as well as (dis)advantages. Furthermore, the key differences will be outlined in the applicable query languages, namely SQL and Cypher.

The main part is dedicated to a setup and execution of a benchmarking test. The goal is to measure and compare the performances of standard database statements used to create, read, update, and delete data. Therefore, a test console application was developed using *Go* in order to consistently and automatically test the given statements with database instances running in *Docker*.

Finally, the benchmarking results are consolidated and interpreted. The findings will be discussed alongside with concrete recommendations in order to facilitate future decision on the given database paradigm.
